# COA Projects

This repository contains a collection of all my projects developed for the Computer Organization and Architecture (COA) course. Each project focuses on a different fundamental component of digital systems. Below is an overview of each project included in this repository.

## Projects

### 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder

This project implements a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder. The circuit consists of 4 1bit Full-Adders circuits , thus generate a 4bit Sum & a 1bit Carry.

- [4bit_ripple_Carry_Adder.v](https://github.com/RDX-Rudra/Verilog/blob/main/Adder/rippleCarryAdder.v): Verilog code for the adder-cum-subtractor

### 4-bit Adder-Cum-Subtractor

This project implements a 4-bit adder-cum-subtractor. The circuit can perform both addition and subtraction based on a control signal.

- [4bit_adder_Cum_Subtractor.v](https://github.com/RDX-Rudra/Verilog/blob/main/Adder/adderCumSubtractor.v): Verilog code for the adder-cum-subtractor
 
### 1-bit 4-to-1 Multiplexer

This project creates a 1-bit 4-to-1 multiplexer. The multiplexer selects one of four input bits based on two selection lines.
There are Two Ways of Implementing it.

- **Structural Variant**  : [1bit_4to1_mux_struct.v](https://github.com/RDX-Rudra/Verilog/blob/main/mux1b4to1_struct.v)
- **Behavioural Variant** : [1bit_4to1_mux_behav.v](https://github.com/RDX-Rudra/Verilog/blob/main/mux1b4to1_behav.v)
